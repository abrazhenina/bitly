# Bitly url shortener

This script generates a short link (bitlink) to your long link and also counts a number of clicks if given a bitlink.

### How to install

Python3 should be already installed. 
Then use `pip` (or `pip3`, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Also you need to create ".env" file in the directiory with the sctipt and set there an environement variable TOKEN, the value for that variable you can find if you register on [api.bitly.com](https://app.bitly.com/settings/api/) and generate your token there.
